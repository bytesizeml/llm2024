### Pre-requisites
The course assumes that you have the basics of machine learning and are comfortable coding in Python. If this is not the case, please reach out to the TAs or the instructor asap.
Set up is also key for success in the course. Assignment 1 partly takes care of the setup (coding environment, APIs, etc).

### Flavor of the Course
The course will be a modern introduction to deep learning, transformers, GPT and beyond. We will have a mix of concepts, examples, applications in the industry, theory, algorithms, code and demos. Expect a lot of hands-on
coding assignments and mini-projects. Towards the later half of the course, we will start to touch on the latest trends in Generative AI. 

### Lecture Dates
1.  Tuesday, 4-6 pm **In-person**
2. Thursday, 4-6 pm **Online**
